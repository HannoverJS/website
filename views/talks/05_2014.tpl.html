            <h3>Christoph Burgdorf - <span class="speaker__talk-name">ninya.io - a search engine to make skilled people in tech more discoverable</span></h3>

            <p>
                <a href="http://www.ninya.io">ninya.io</a> is all about making skilled people in tech more discoverable. It might be
                best described as a search engine to find tech people. Basically it let's you search for
                people by their skillset and location.

                For instance <a href="http://www.ninya.io/#/?q=location:%20hannover,%20hanover%20answers:%20javascript,%20angularjs,css,%20html">here are some people from Hannover who seem to be web folks!</a>
            </p>

            <p>Christoph started <a href="http://www.ninya.io">ninya.io</a> as a quick holiday hack in August 2013. Since then it has grown into a serious project with it's own set of challenges and fun parts.</p>
            <p>In his talk Christoph will talk about the tech stack, including it's turbulent history, challenges and future plans.</p>

            <p>As a bonus you might see some Go code in this talk!</p>

            <h3>Robin Thrift - <span class="speaker__talk-name">Metalsmith - A fun, pluggable JavaScript static site generator</span></h3>

            <p>
                Imagine <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> mixed with <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and a little bit of magic. Add to that a dead simple plugin system and you've got yourself a pretty darn amazing static site generator. That's what the folks over at <a href="https://segment.io/">Segment.io</a> thought to themselves and built <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io">Metalsmith</a>, a pluggable JavaScript static site generator. 
            </p>

            <p>This talk will show you, exactly how easy it is, to build static websites using Metalsmith. From the first parsed markdown file to building a super simple plugin, you'll fall in love with Metalsmiths simplicity and its declarative nature.</p>
