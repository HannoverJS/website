        <p>As There're many JavaScript usergroups out there, like <a href="http://colognejs.de/">Cologne.js</a>, <a href="http://berlinjs.org">Berlin.js</a>, <a href="http://www.munichjs.org/">Munich.js</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/">Hamburg.js</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cburgdorf">Christoph Burgdorf</a> decided to bring
        another JavaScript usergroup to life in Hannover. So here it is!<p>

        <p>Our sessions focus on specific subjects, such as using JavaScript Patterns, or developing with frameworks. Other meetups are more open and collaborative, e.g. show nâ€™ tells and hack nights. We put as much emphasis into learning new things, as into coming together as a community and making connections that are useful in our daily work as web developers.</p>
